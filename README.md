# Cappy bird
- Cappy bird is a game imitating the game flappy bird. It is played by pressing space, so that the bird jumps. When you play the game you have to press space often for gravity pulls the bird back down. Don't hit the pipes, you'll die. But you can start over by pressing space. The game tracks your points, you get 1 point for every pipe you get through and 1 point for every coin you hit.
- The game is made for a school project by jscode1003. The project consists of game.js, index.html and styles.css + bird.png and background.png. The game is coded in OOP with inheritance from GameObject to Bird, Pipe and Coin. The game is mainly made with JavaScript, but has html and css files to make the project clear and openable.
